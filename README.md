## ABSTRACT
Bug prediction place a vital role in  enhancing software quality and reducing maintenance cost by identifying potential defect early in the development life cycle. This project  introduces a nature based prediction model for bug reports,leveraging the principles of machine learning combined with inspiration from nature inspired algorithm.The model integrates evoluationary computation swam intelligence, and bio inspired optimization techniques to analyze and predict the occurrence and severity of software bugs. This paper address the challenge of analyzing bug reports(BRs) to predict  the nature of bugs. To solve this,we propose a prediction model leveraging natural language processing(NLP) and machine learning techniques.Using an ensemble approach, the model integrates multiple methods to analyze BRs effectively.Among the algorithms evaluated XG Boost demonstrated superior performance with maximum accuracy. Making it an efficient and reliable solution for automatic bug classification in software development systems.


### 1.2	PROBLEM STATEMENT
In software development, the maintenance phase is crucial for fixing defects and ensuring software quality. Bug reports (BRs) play a central role in this process by providing detailed information about defects in the software. However, as the volume of bug reports increases over time, the process of manually analyzing and categorizing them becomes increasingly tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming. Current research on automated bug analysis often focuses on tasks like predicting bug severity or priority, but it overlooks a critical aspect: the nature of the bug itself.

   ### 4.2 PROPOSED SYSTEM:
In the proposed system, we are using ensemble algorithm by combining various algorithms using Voting Classifier and then this algorithm will vote out each algorithm and then select algorithm with highest accuracy. Voting classifier combining various classifier such as Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, SVM and Random Forest. Each algorithms run individually and with Voting classifier and Voting Classifier giving high accuracy. As extension we have experimented with XGBOOST algorithm which is consider as one of the advance ML algorithm and known for better prediction accuracy.
Advantages:
•	Higher accuracy.
•	Detection accuracy is increased. 
•	Proposed Algorithms bug prediction models are based on Ensembled  machine learning algorithms.
